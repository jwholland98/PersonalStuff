Final will be on May 12 for 2 hrs available from 8am-11:59pm
	100% multiple choice (Fact Based) Comprehensive
		60 multiple choice questions
Only chapters we walked through are on the test
May 12 11:59pm all assigments/projects are due
Chapter 4:
	Process
		What a process is compared to a thread
		Context Switch for a process
			We experimented with a Context switch for a thread
Chapter 5: ***
		fork
			return value fork
		Fork Bomb
Chapter 6:
		Direct Execution
			Don't want to have to recompile to execute a program
			 [code]
			 [data]
			 [heap]
			   |
			   V
			   ^
			   |
			 [stack]
Chapter 7:
		Scheduling
			Perfect would allow perfect scheduling
			Easy simple approaches usually have
				to have some fixes
			Complicated approaches because of
				imperfect knowledge
Chapter 8:
		One interesting scheduling approach
			ML  queue highest
				queue slightly lower
				queue less 
				queue lowest
		I/O operation that is obvious we should 
			queue a process or thread
Chapter 9:
		Another interesting sheduling approach
Chapter 13:
		History to the "executable footprint"
			 [code]
			 [data]
			 [heap]
			   |
			   V
			   ^
			   |
			 [stack]
Chapter 14: ***
		Memory API
			malloc, free 
				new, delete C++
				forced them to use MyMalloc, MyFree
			malloc hook
			Tools for finding memory leaks
Chapter 15:
		Direct Execution the executable could
			be located anywhere in actual address space
Chapter 16:
		Segmentation
			Get further away from actual memory 
			versus the idealized "Executable footprint"
			Some upper bits are the segment
			x86 shifting 4 bits add 
				cs<<4+ip
				cs<<8+ip
				ecs<<16+eip
		seg-fault
Chapter 17:
		Free space Management
			Free-List
			Space efficient but quick to find space
Chapter 18:  
		Paging
			Subdivision of memory for purpose of speed
			persisting them out to disk
			Permissions,  read/write/execute
Chapter 19:
		Translation LookAside Buffers
			Implementation of Segment and Paging
Chapter 20:
		Additional paging technique
Chapter 21:
			Trading disk space for memory space
			swappiness  when to start using swap?
Chapter 22:
			LRU least recently used
Chapter 23: Complete VM system
		Summary chapter of all the orange
Chapter 26:
		Threads (vs Processes)
		Shared
			Code, Data and Heap with different stack
Chapter 27: ***
		Pthread library
		Should be able to interpret api for threads
			locks, and condition variable
Chapter 28:  Formal introduction to locks
		Why do I need locks, cond variables ...
			Context Switch can occurr anytime anywhere
				How to you make sure
				code correctly computes
		Critical Section
		lock, unlock
Chapter 29:
		Demonstration of how to lock ADT you should 
			know
Chapter 30: Condition Variables
		signal, wait
			wait for a signal
			send a signal
Chapter 31: Semaphores
		wait for a sign (semaphores)
		post post a sign
		Binary Semaphore  -> Lock
Chapter 32: 
		Built it all now what could go wrong
			Giving names to what could go wrong
		Deadlock (Dining Philosophers)
			needing two resources before you proceed
		LiveLock (busily trying to get to critical section)
		Other concurrency issues might be more 
		frequent that Deadlock.
Chapter 33:
		Event based Concurrency
			Async world of Node.js
Chapter 36:
		I/O Devices
			Character 		vs Block
			Single register vs DMA
			Interrupt
				hardware forcing a function call
					Interrupt handler should be fast
					and get control back to program
			Direct Memory Access
				Bulk data moved between device and 
				  memory
			Device bridges between kernel and user
Chapter 37:
		Disk Drives 
			Track, Sector, Seeking
			Seek time which
				head moving to track
				data spinning around to be under the
				head
Chapter 38: RAID
		Redundancy
		Performance
Chapter 39:
		Files and directories
			dirent  important library
			stat	information about the files
Chapter 40:  Formal idea and walkthrough the filesystem
		Inode, IBitmap, DBitmap, structures
Chapter 44:
		Understand wear leveling and issues with 
		SSD block organization, blank page
		Make it act like old spinning disk		
Chapter 42:  -- Not on test
		FSCK checking file system errors
