            -9600 bits per some baud
            - 8-N-1
                - shows how the data is sent
                - for above, it means start bit, 8 bits of data, no odd or even bit, and 1 stop bit; total: 10
                - Another example would be: 7-E-2
                    - start bit, 7 bits of data, even bit, and 2 stop bits; total: 11
            - transmit time for 1024 bytes
                    9600 bps/(8 + 1(start bit) + 1(stop bit that comes from 8-N-*1*)) = 960 Bps
                    960 Bps/1024 Bps = answer

            - 100 Mbps = megabits per second
                - B = bytes
                - b = bits
                - Sources of Distortion
            - there will be some data loss no matter the method
                - Electricomagnetic
                - Resistance wire
                - Radio Interference
            - There is a speed limit to wires i.e. some are faster than others (fourier spreadsheet)
            - Data Link layer should detect and correct the errors
                - talk slower on the wire is one solution

                    - Start RS-232
                - synchronous vs Asynchronous:
                    - synchronous shares a clock, Asynchronous does not
                - RS-232 - AKA - UART - AKA
                    - TX
                        - transmit wire
                    - RX
                        - recieve wire
                    - Asynchronous (we have to agree on the seed in which we talk to it - think arduino)
                - SPI
