        gethostbyname -> dev interface to DNS

DHCP
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol ***
    Automatic way of assigning ip address to machine
    DHCP Server - window of IP addresses to hand out
        Network Mask
            255.255.255.0
            255.255.0.0

NAT
    Network Address Translation
    The WAN IP address is not the same as LAN IP address
    Security outside people don't know number of machines (unless they respond)
    It also delayed the IPV6 change over because you only need 4 octet addresses at highest level

Firewall
    Rejects incoming packets that were not requested
    Stealthing a port
        No response for unused ports
    Punch a hole for a web server, hackers will see the Webserver

    RFC's describe protocols
